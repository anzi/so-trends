## Stack Overflow Trends

A Shiny application that shows trends in Stack Overflow questions over time. View the app [here](https://dgrtwo.shinyapps.io/so-trends/).

This uses open data from the [StackLite dataset](https://github.com/dgrtwo/StackLite). (See [here](setup-data.R) for the code that processes StackLite into tag-per-year data).
